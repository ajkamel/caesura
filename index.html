			<p>caesura<br>

			<h1>About the Project</h1>
			<p><i><b>caesura: a forum</b></i> is a temporary, site-specific architectural and sound installation on the Acropolis at Marcus Garvey Park in Harlem.</p>
			<p>Visually and sonically, caesura draws from the social situation and built forms characterizing its location. The park’s Mount Morris hill, made of massive rock outcroppings is home to a large open space that overlooks Harlem called “the acropolis.” The height of the site made for an ideal location for a fire watchtower, and in 1857 the Harlem Fire Watchtower was built. It’s bell was rung to signal a fire by volunteer fire watchers. The tower has had a number of transformations through it’s life and is a local icon around which historic Harlem events have convened. Today, the bell is silent. The tower, the only one still in existence from it’s time period in NYC, was dismantled this spring for much needed restoration. The acropolis has incredible, expansive views. The tower’s restoration plans have brought increased interest to what had become an under utilized site and the acropolis is undergoing transformation as people have come to see it during the dismantling. The hope is that more Harlem residents, visitors and history enthusiasts will continue to appreciate the beauty of the acropolis. Without the draw of the Harlem Fire Watchtower itself, caesura endeavors to activate the site through viewing and listening reframing history with a temporary structure and sound.

			<h1>Architecture</h1>
			<p>The architectural component of this piece begins at the acropolis’ ground as an open air, steel frame, which supports a “horizontal tower” figuration, that the viewer can pass through and meander under. In the center of the piece, the “bell” made of mirrored steel reflects the sky to the south, where the tower stood, and the expansive view to the north of the city. Above, the rectilinear, exterior skeleton of the horizontal figure becomes a curvaceous form on the interior when the inhabitant looks up. The double-curved surfaces are seen through film tape, linear tubes and profiles of steel. Light and air movements dynamically open, pattern and break from the undulating form. Sonically, the skin resonates with voices and music and the “bell” rings with rhythm and chime by use of electromagnetic transducers attached in the fabric and on the steel. New and old histories recorded, spliced and digitally scripted together, activate the acropolis and pause throughout the day. listening . gathering . voicing .</p>
